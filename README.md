# getting-started-with-d3
Git repo for code used in the Pluralsight course, "Getting Started with D3"

Code is organized by the *end-state* of each module, that is, the M2 folder contains the state of the code after the work in the last demo in M2.

## Data Server for Loading Data
The code for the data server is located in the DataServer folder. The code is .Net 6 code, but there's nothing particular to the data it generates, so I **strongly** encourage you to work with a server that is relevant to your work.

### Getting the Server Running Locally
To get the DataServer running, you must:
1. Install the .Net runtime
.Net runs on Windows, Linux, or MacOS platforms, and you can download it at this link: [Install .Net](http://https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60 "Install .Net")
2. Execute this command in the DataServer/DataServer_v6 folder: `dotnet run`

### Optional
You may choose to install Visual Studio, the editor I use in the course, which can be downloaded for free here: [Install Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ "Install Visual Studio Community"). With that tool, you can open the DataServer project and run it within the tool. This will also allow you to fiddle with the code and see how the visualizations react, which I strongly recommend.

#### Thank you for watching my course, and, as always, let me know if you have any questions!!!
